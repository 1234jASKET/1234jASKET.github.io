           <p>
Patience is the art of hoping without wearing oneself out.
 La patience est l’art d’espérer sans s’épuiser
“הסבלנות היא האמנות של לקוות מבלי להתעייף.
La paciencia es el arte de esperar sin agotarse
Pasyans se atizay espere san fatige tèt ou.
Η υπομονή είναι η τέχνη του να ελπίζεις χωρίς να εξαντλείσαι.
Patientia est ars sperandi sine defatigatione.

        <h7 class="html">On Sunday, May 11, 2025, Pope Leo XIV delivered his first Sunday prayer from the balcony of St.
            Peter’s Basilica, before a crowd estimated at approximately 100,000 people.
            He recited the Regina Caeli, a traditional Marian prayer for the Easter season, in honor of the Virgin Mary.</h7>

        <h1 id="hello">At the end of this prayer, the Pope made a fervent appeal for peace, declaring, “Never again war!” He called for a “just and lasting” peace in Ukraine and demanded an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, including the release of hostages and the distribution of humanitarian aid.



This first public address by Pope Leo XIV marks the beginning of his pontificate, ahead of his inaugural mass scheduled for May 18.
