        <p>
            good evening and good night 

         Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be 
         Your Name, Your kingdom come,
         Thy will be done
         on earth as in heaven.
         Give us today
         our bread today.
         Forgive us our trespasses
         just as we also forgive those who have 
         offended us.
         And do not let us enter into temptation, 
         but deliver us from evil.
